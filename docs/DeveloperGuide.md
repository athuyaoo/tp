### 2.1 Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given below explains the high-level design of the App.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:

Event           | Description
--------------- | -----------
At app launch   | Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
At shut down    | Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

Component                            | Description
------------------------------------ | -----------
[**`UI`**](#22-ui-component)            | Builds the UI of the App.
[**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component)      | Executes the different commands.
[**`Model`**](#24-model-component)      | Holds the data of the App in memory.
[**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component)  | Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the ***Logic Class Diagram*** given below shows the `Logic` component. It defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The ***Sequence Diagram*** given below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI Component

The ***UI Class Diagram*** given below shows the structure of the `UI` component.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 2.3 Logic Component

The ***Logic Class Diagram*** given below shows the structure of the `Logic` component.

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component consists of `LogicManager`, `Parser`, `Command`, etc. The `Logic` component parses and executes the user command.   

The `Parser` component is defined in `src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/parser` folder, `XYZCommandParser` inherits from `Parser` and parses the respective `XYZCommand`. 

The `Command` component is defined in `src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/commands` folder, `XYZCommand` inherits from `Command`. 

The following steps explain the interactions of `Logic` component to parse and execute the user command:

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

The ***Logic Component Sequence Diagram*** given below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### 2.4 Model Component

The ***Model Class Diagram*** given below shows the structure of the `Model` component.

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The ***Alternative Model Class Diagram*** given below shows an alternative (arguably, more OOP) model of the `Model` component.

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

It has a `Tag` list in the `Hall-y`, which `Person` references. This allows `Hall-y` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

</div>


### 2.5 Storage Component

The ***Storage Class Diagram*** given below shows the structure of the `Storage` component.

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* saves the address book data in json format and read it back.

### 2.6 Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.AddressBook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3 Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Exporting of information

#### 3.1.1 Implementation
The export feature is facilitated by `FileWriter` from Java's IO library.
Currently, only email address and phone number can be exported. 

The key idea is that we will iterate through the current list and access the relevant information fields.
This operation depends on the size of the current person list and will be relatively fast.
We will then write the information into a .txt file located at `/data/hall.txt` each separated by a new line. 

Given below is a step-by-step usage scenario of how the `export` feature works:

1. The user launches the application and inputs `export email` into the input box.

2. The `LogicManager#execute()` is then called, and the input is parsed through `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, returning an `ExportCommand`.

3. The `export` command then calls `ExportCommand#execute()`, and calls `Model#getAddressBook()` followed by `ReadOnlyAddressBook#getPersonList()` to get the current list of persons.

4. The person list is then passed to `ExportCommand#handlEmail()` which iterates through the list and calls `Person#getEmail()` to access the `Email` and writes to the file `hally.txt`

The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:
![](https://i.imgur.com/bbOtDI2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> 
If the current person list is empty, an empty hally.txt file will be created.
</div>

#### 3.1.2 Design consideration:

##### Aspect: What file format to export to

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Write to a .txt file.

Pros | Cons
-----|-----
\+ More user-friendly <br> + Most operating systems is able to open .txt files natively. | - Does not offer much functionality apart from viewing and copying. 

* **Alternative 2:** Write to a .json file

Pros | Cons
-----|-----
\+ More well-known among developers | - Less technical users may not know how to open a .json file.

### 3.2 Adding of events

#### 3.2.1 Implementation
The add event feature is facilitated by the `AddEventCommand`.
It extends `Command` and overrides `Command#execute()` to perform the adding of events.

The key idea is that we will pass the user's input into the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`. 
It will create an `Event` with the user's inputs and associate it with `AddEventCommand`.
When `AddEventCommand#execute()` is called, the associated `Event` is passed into the `Model` component.
The `Model` component then saves the `Event`.

Given below is a step-by-step usage scenario and how the add event feature works:
1. The user launches the application and inputs `add-event n/Hall Dinner d/Dinner@Dining Hall` into the input box.
2. The `UI` component accepts the input and passes it to `LogicManager#execute()`.
3. The input is parsed through `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, returning an `AddEventCommand` with an `Event` class associated to it.
4. The `LogicManager` class then calls `AddEventCommand#execute()`, which uses `Model#addEvent()` to save the associated `Event` class.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add event operation works:
![Add Event Sequence Diagram](diagrams/commands/dg-add-event.png)

#### 3.2.2 Design consideration:

#### Aspect: When to create the new `Event` class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create the new `Event` in `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`

Pros | Cons
-----| -----
\+ Early conversion of user's input into `Event` class<br />+ Consistent with the existing code base</span> | - Increases dependency between `Logic` and `Model` component

* **Alternative 2**: Create the new `Event` in `AddEventCommand#execute()`

Pros | Cons
-----|-----
\+ Decreases dependency between `Logic` and `Model` component | - Late conversion of user's input into `Event` class

We decided to use **Alternative 1** as it is simpler.

For **Alternative 2**, we found it to be too complex. The user's input has to be passed across the different components.
By converting it to an `Event` class early, we can work at a higher level of abstraction.
Other methods do not have to worry about string's format, and can focus on handling it as an `Event` class.

### 3.3 Persistent block and room settings

#### 3.3.1 Implementation
This feature is implemented by making use of a json file to store the blocks and rooms info of the Hall. It does this by defining all available block and rooms in an editable json file. 

A predefined configuration with the following settings will be set as default:

Blocks : A, B, C, D  
Rooms : 100 - 420

Blocks are represented as a single alphabet in uppercase. Rooms are represented as <Level><Room number>.
The default settings specifies that the hall will have 4 blocks, A, B, C and D. There are 4 levels with 20 rooms per level.  
Advanced users can edit the json file directly to change these settings


Given below is a step-by-step usage scenario of how this feature will ensure that there are no invalid inputs for the block and room field:

1. The user launches the application and tries to add a new user by typing  
`add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS br/ROOM_NUMBER g/GENDER m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER [s/STUDENT_GROUP...]` into the input box.

2. The `LogicManager#execute()` is then called, and the input is parsed through `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, returning an `AddCommand`.

3. The `AddCommand` then calls `AddCommand#execute()`, and passes all the arguments to the `Person` constructor.

4. The `Person` constructor proceeds to create a new `Person` object with all the fields, 2 of which are `Block` and `Room`.

5. The `Block` and `Room` calls `Block#isValidBlock()` and `Room#isValidRoom()` respectively to parse the json file and compares the input arguments with the information specified in the json file. 

6. A new `Block` and `Room` is returned if the input arguments matches the info specified in the json file. Otherwise, an exception is thrown and the result box will inform the user of the invalid input.

The following sequence diagram shows how this feature works:
![](images/BlockRoomValidationDiagram.png)

#### 3.3.2 Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Method of modifying the json file

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Editing it directly

Pros | Cons
-----|-----
\+ Easier to implement <br> | - Less technical users may not know how to edit the file correctly 

* **Alternative 2:** Via a command

Pros | Cons
-----|-----
\+ All users will be able to edit the file safely | - Troublesome to implement

Due to time constraints, we decided to use **Alternative 1** as **Alternative 2** would require much more work since we would require more rigorous testing to ensure that it is bug free. 

### 3.4 Listing all student groups

#### 3.4.1 Implementation
The listing all student groups feature is facilitated by `ListGroupCommand`. It extends `Command` and overrides `Command#execute()` to list all student groups.

Given below is a step-by-step usage scenario and how the listing all student groups feature works:

1. The user launches the application and types `list-group` into the input box.
2. The `UI` handles the input and calls `LogicManager#execute()` to execute it.
3. The `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` is called to parse the input and returns a `ListGroupCommand`.
4. The `ListGroupCommand` calls `ListGroupCommand#execute()` which retrieves the list of all residents by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
5. The `ListGroupCommand#execute()` iterates through the list of all residents and then gets a set of all residents' student groups.
6. The `ListGroupCommand#execute()` iterates through the set of all student groups and formats it to a `String` result.     
7. The `UI` displays the result in the result box.

The following sequence diagram shows how the listing all student groups operation works:
![Listing Student Groups Sequence Diagram](images/ListGroupSequenceDiagram.png)  

### 3.5 Finding Students

#### 3.5.1 Implementation
The finding of students based on their characteristics is facilitated by the `FindCommand`.
It extends `Command` and overrides `Command#execute()` to find students.

The high-level idea is that the user input from the `FindCommand` will be passed into the 
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`. Based on user input, it will form a list of predicates
that will return true if a resident matches the given inputs.

Given below is a step-by-step usage scenario and how the finding of students works:

1. The user launches the application and types `find n/meier b/B` into the input box.
2. The `UI` handles the input and calls `LogicManager#execute()` to execute it.
3. The `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` is called to parse the input, which calls `FindCommandParser#parseCommand()`,
subsequently returning a `FindCommand` with the associated list of predicates.
4. The `FindCommand` calls `FindCommand#execute()` which forms a predicate that fulfill every predicate from the list.
5. The predicate updates the filtered list of all residents by calling `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`.
The resulting filtered list matches this predicate, which means that it matches all predicates in the original list.
7. The `UI` displays the result in the result box.

The following sequence diagram shows how finding students works:
![Find Sequence Diagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)  

#### 3.5.2 Design consideration:

#### Aspect: When to convert list of predicates to a single predicate

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create the predicate during `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`

Pros | Cons
-----| -----
\+ Memory is freed earlier as list of predicates is converted immediately | - Makes testing of equal find commands more difficult

* **Alternative 2**: Create the predicate during `FindCommand#execute()`

Pros | Cons
-----|-----
\+ It is easier to compare equality for `FindCommand` objects<br/>\+ It is easier to test | - More memory is needed to store the list of predicates for longer period of time

We decided to use **Alternative 2** as it increases testability by making it simpler to test.

For **Alternative 1**, it is difficult to compare 2 predicates as they have been merged together. 
With **Alternative 2**, it is easier to compare each equality of each element in the list of predicates instead to check whether the `FindCommand` objects are equal. 
As testing is important to ensuring that programs run correctly, we decided to use alternative 2.
